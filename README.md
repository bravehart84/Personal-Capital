# Personal-Capital

Hello,

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this Selenium code challenge. I automated the steps as instructed, I used the Page Object model 

with a Base Page, and other pages like the 'Homepage', 'Financial tools' page and 'SignUp' pages inheriting from the Basepage. Our test class is called

testing.js in the tests folder. It makes use of methods from our page classes to execute the steps. You can just run it using 'mocha testing.js'

and watch it execute the following workflow: Go to  https://www.personalcapital.com/
                                              Click on ‘Financial Tools’,
                                              In the Financial Tools page click on ‘Sign up’ button,
                                              Fill the form,
                                              No need to submit the form.
 There is also a HTML report available in the 'reporters' folder.
                                              
 Thank you once again, if you have any questions, or need me to add anything to the code, I'm available and would be happy to respond to your request!
